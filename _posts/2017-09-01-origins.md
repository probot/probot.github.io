### The name "Probot"

Names are hard. While I've had a pretty clear idea of _what_ I wanted Probot to be from the beginning, I had no idea what to call it.

It originally had a [placeholder name](https://github.com/probot/probot/commit/1f838dfb1c0da1276c77bdda3482d50f22e0d585) of `[Bot Name]`. It was briefly called it `GitHubBot`, or [HubBot](https://github.com/probot/probot/commit/bb04d3b18a14bedfc5c87a79cb5394b9f14ba0e7) for short, until I realized that’s [super confusing](https://hubot.github.com). In a moment of panic, with the pressure of a blinking cursor staring me in the face, I spent at least 30 seconds brainstorming: GitHub Bot. GitBot, Pull Request Robot. PR Robot. Probiotic? Ooh, I like the connotation of that, but that's a little weird. PR Robot? PRobot?

It was [renamed it to PRobot](https://github.com/probot/probot/commit/ad413762e3d5c9794eb832e2e3daeecebe4bbbad) (short for PR Robot) to clear up the `HubBot` confusion, but it was intended to be a placeholder name. The `README` said:

>  _NOTE: this README is aspirational, and the project name is guaranteed to change._

We went with PRobot for a while…until people started calling it names. I was called everything from P-R-O-bot to P-R-obot, with the meanest of them all: Pee-Robot. In a fit of (documentation) rage, the [name was changed to Probot]( https://github.com/probot/probot/commit/e5c0ee96800eb9d626e20f74256163d4481d29f8), and shortly after, the [note about the name being guaranteed to change was removed](https://github.com/probot/probot/commit/c01224333d0c1688eb43087f0c883f71f7e7ea73#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8L5).

I still don’t love the name
