> App built using [Probot](https://probot.github.io/) which generates a weekly automated summary of activity on your GitHub repository
## App in Action ##
![A Weekly Digest generated by app.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20141002/41304450-d2bc9234-6e8d-11e8-965d-649ed2d04651.gif)

## Features ##

When the Weekly Digest App gets installed in a repository of a user or organization, it curates together the following data and publishes it as an issue:

- Issues created in the last one week
  - Open Issues
  - Closed Issues
  - Noisy Issue
  - Liked Issue
- Pull requests opened, updated, or merged in the last pull request
  - Opened Pull Requests
  - Updated Pull Requests
  - Merged Pull Requests
- Commits made in the master branch, in the last week
- Contributors, adding contributions in the last week
- Stargazers, or the fans of your repositories, who really loved your repo
- Releases, of the project you are working on

The app, as the name suggests, generates these digests and publishes it on weekly basis, typically on a Sunday. 

One can change the default configuration of the app by adding a _.github/weekly-digest.yml_ file in their GitHub repository, which allows them to configure the publish day and the specific information included in the digest.
