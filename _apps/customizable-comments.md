## Configuration options

_ðŸ“’ Currently, this Probot App only supports `pull_request.opened` events._

_I would be happy to add more, just submit a PR or Issue with what you'd find useful._

### Built-in template vars

| name               | value                                                                                                            | used when      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| \$BRANCH           | The branch name of the PR                                                                                        | `pull_request` |
| \$BRANCH_SANITIZED | The branch name of the PR but sanitized as safe for URL prefixes (lowercased, `.` and `/` are replaced with `-`) | `pull_request` |

### Custom template vars

You can configure your own variable replacements using the `vars:` block in the yml file. See the example below:

## Example

```yaml
vars:
  - name: $MY_CUSTOM
    value: my-value

pull_request:
  opened:
    template: |
      Here's a helpful URL based on the branch name: https://$BRANCH.something.example.com
      And here's my custom value: $MY_CUSTOM
```

The above will auto-reply with a comment like so:

```
Here's a helpful URL based on the branch name: https://the-branch.something.example.com
And here's my custom value: my-custom
```
