# customizable-comments (probot-cc)

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that auto-replies with customizable comments based on template vars

<img src="https://github.com/tizmagik/customizable-comments/raw/master/probot-cc-sample.png" />

## Usage

1. Install the [Customizable Comments (probot-cc) GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/probot-cc) into the repo(s) you wish to use it on.
1. Add a `.github/customizable-comments.yml` configuration file to each repo. You can also

Customizable Comments also supports [Probot Config](https://github.com/probot/probot-config), if you want to store your configuration files in a central repository. This allows you to share configurations between projects, and create an organization-wide configuration file by creating a repository named `.github` and file named `customizable-comments.yml`.

## Configuration options

_üìí Currently, this Probot App only supports `pull_request.opened` events._

_I would be happy to add more, just submit a PR or Issue with what you'd find useful._

### Built-in template vars

| name     | value                     | used when      |
| -------- | ------------------------- | -------------- |
| \$BRANCH | The branch name of the PR | `pull_request` |

### Custom template vars

You can configure your own variable replacements using the `vars:` block in the yml file. See the example below:

## Example

```yaml
vars:
  - name: $MY_CUSTOM
    value: my-value

pull_request:
  opened:
    template: |
      Here's a helpful URL based on the branch name: https://$BRANCH.something.example.com
      And here's my custom value: $MY_CUSTOM
```

The above will auto-reply with a comment like so:

```
Here's a helpful URL based on the branch name: https://the-branch.something.example.com
And here's my custom value: my-custom
```

## Local Development

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm run dev
```

## Deploying as GCF ‚òÅÔ∏è

This Probot app supports deploying as a Google Cloud Function out of the box:

```
gcloud beta functions deploy gcf-name --env-vars-file .env.yaml --entry-point probot --runtime nodejs8 --trigger-http
```

Where:

- `gcf-name`: desired name of the GCF
- `.env.yaml`: see [.env.yaml.example](./.env.yaml.example)

See [Probot Deployment docs](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/) for other deployment options.
