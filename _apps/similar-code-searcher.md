Developers sometimes forget to change files or components that should be changed at the same time.

## How does bot work

Propose files that should be changed simultaneously by searching for similar lines.

## How to Use:

1. The developer(you) submits a pull request
2. Similar-code-searcher(bot) suggests similar source code files
3. The developer and reviewers verify that should be change at the same time.
4. Change similar code or ignore suggestion and merge PR
