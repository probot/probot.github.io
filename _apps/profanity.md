## Usage

1. **[Configure the GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/profanity)**
2. Create `.github/profanity.yml` based on the following template
3. It will start scanning for offensive issues and/or pull requests within an hour and automatically censor/mark any new ones.

A `.github/profanity.yml` file is required to enable the plugin. The file can be empty, or it can override any of these default settings:

```yml
