Use the `/remind` slash command to set a reminder on any comment box on GitHub and you'll get a ping about it again when the reminder is due.

Use any form of `/remind me [what] [when]`, such as:

- /remind me to deploy on Oct 10
- /remind me next Monday to review the requirements
- /remind me that the specs on the rotary girder need checked in 6 months
