Open issues and pull requests in [Gitpod](http://www.gitpod.io).

## How it works

Gitpod is a one-click online IDE for GitHub. It can be started on any GitHub URL by prefixing it with `gitpod.io#`.
Gitpod Bot generates such links for issues and pull requests and post them as comments.

## Installation

After installing the app, create `.github/gitpod.yml` in the default branch to enable it:

```yml
pulls:
# Enable for pull requests
  perform: true
# Customize a comment to post on a pull request. Comment out to use the default
#  comment:

issues:
# enable for issues
  perform: true
# issues with these labels will be considered. Set to `[]` to disable for issues
  labels:
    - help wanted
    - good first issue
# Customize a comment to post on an issue. Comment out to use the default
#  comment:
```
