A GitHub bot to add status checks for inclusive language. 

> Note: The checks currently run on **public repositories**. This helps limit permissions for organizations with many repositories.

## Configuration

The level of rules can be modified using `.github/in-solidarity.yml`. Check the [sample configuration](https://github.com/jpoehnelt/in-solidarity-bot/blob/main/fixtures/in-solidarity.yml).

```yaml
rules:
  master:
    level: off
  slave:
    level: failure
ignore:
 - ".github/in-solidarity.yml"  # default
 - "**/*.yml"
```

The rule names are in [rules.ts](https://github.com/jpoehnelt/in-solidarity-bot/blob/main/src/rules.ts). Contributions are welcome!

## Why

> Complex and subtle configurations of sexist, racist, or ethnocentric language use in technical documents can derail or interfere with readersâ€™ ability and desire to comprehend and follow important information.
