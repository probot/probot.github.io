A dependency manager for your Pull Requests.

## Usage

1.  Browse to [GitHub Apps - dep][apps]
2.  Accept the permissions
3.  Allow access to repositories

If you want to update a pull request dependencies write:

![comment-screenshot][]

On the pull request, a status check from `dep` will appear:

![status-check-screenshot][]

For best results, enable branch protection (in the repository's settings) and require the `dep` status check to pass before merging:
