Replies to toxic comments with a maintainer designated reply and a link to the repo's code of conduct. It does so by taking data from a `.github/config.yml`.

You can tell from this example just how toxic I am ðŸ˜œ

## Usage

1. Install the bot on the intended repositories. The app requires the following **Permissions and Events**:
- Issues: **Read & Write**
  - **Issue Comment** events
2. Add a `.github/config.yml` file that contains the following:

```yml
# Configuration for sentiment-bot - https://github.com/behaviorbot/sentiment-bot

# *Required* toxicity threshold between 0 and .99 with the higher numbers being the most toxic
# Anything higher than this threshold will be marked as toxic and commented on
sentimentBotToxicityThreshold: .7

# *Required* Comment to reply with
sentimentBotReplyComment: >
  Please be sure to review the code of conduct and be respectful of other users. cc/ @hiimbex

# Note: the bot will only work if your repository has a Code of Conduct
```
3. Be sure to check out the [Perspective API](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/) before choosing your toxicity threshold to get a feel for what kind of comments would register at what toxicity threshold.
