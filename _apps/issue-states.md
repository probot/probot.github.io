A GitHub App that closes or reopens issues when they are moved to a project column.

## Usage

1. **[Install the GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/issue-states)**
   for the intended repositories
2. Start adding or moving issues to the project columns defined
   in `openIssueColumns` and `closedIssueColumns`

Issues which were already in the respective columns before the app
was installed will not be processed. To process these issues,
move them to a different column, then move them back.

Care must be taken during the use of the app to not conflict
with project automation presets on GitHub.

**If possible, install the app only for select repositories.
Do not leave the `All repositories` option selected, unless you intend
to use the app for all current and future repositories.**

#### Configuration

Optionally, create `.github/issue-states.yml` in the default branch
of the repository or add it at the same file path to a repository
named `.github` to override any of these default settings:

```yaml
# Configuration for Issue States - https://github.com/dessant/issue-states

# Open issues that are moved to these project columns. Set to `[]` to disable
openIssueColumns: []

# Close issues that are moved to these project columns. Set to `[]` to disable
closedIssueColumns:
  - Closed
  - Done

# Repository to extend settings from
# _extends: repo
```
