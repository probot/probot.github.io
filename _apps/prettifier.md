Prettifier keeps your repository content formatted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io).

Standardized code formatting is an important best practice for building happy, collaborative communities.
It prevents pointless bikeshed debates. It makes different people's code look more similar, so that everybody feels more at home in each other's code. Pull requests become easier to review because they don't contain unnecessary whitespace changes.

[Prettier](https://prettier.io) is an independent open-source project to format a wide variety of source code languages. If you use Prettier, this bot can help you. It checks changes made to your codebase and formats them using Prettier if needed.
