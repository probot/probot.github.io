# Create Issue Branch

> A GitHub app that creates a new branch after assigning an issue

## What does this app do?

The typical workflow is:
 1. An issue is created

 *some time may pass*
 
 2. The issue is assigned
 3. This app will create a new branch for this issue

If the issue is re-assigned no new branch will be created.

## Installation

You can install the app directly from [*this page*](https://github.com/apps/create-issue-branch)

## Feedback, suggestions and bug reports

Please create an issue here: https://github.com/robvanderleek/create-issue-brancg/issues
