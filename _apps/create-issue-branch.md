# Create Issue Branch

> A GitHub App/Action that automates the creation of issue branches (either automatically after assigning an issue or after commenting on an issue with a ChatOps command: `/create-issue-branch` or `/cib`).

Built in response to this feature reuest issue: 
https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1125

## What does this app do?

This app can support your development workflow in two ways (modes): auto and chatops.

In "auto" mode the typical development workflow is:

 1. An issue is created, for example: Issue 15: Fix nasty bug!

 *some time may pass*

 2. The issue is assigned
 3. When the issue is assigned this app will create a new issue branch
    (for the example issue this branch will be called `issue-15-Fix_nasty_bug`)

In "chatops" mode the typical development workflow is:

 1. An issue is created, for example: Issue 15: Fix nasty bug!

 *some time may pass*

 2. A developer that wants to work on this issue gives the ChatOps command `/cib` as a comment on the issue
 3. This app will create a new issue branch
    (for the example issue this branch will be called `issue-15-Fix_nasty_bug`)
    By default the app notifies creation is completed with a comment on the issue.

## Installation

There are two options to run this app as part of your development workflow:

1. [Install](https://github.com/apps/create-issue-branch) it as an *app* for your organization/account/repository
2. Run it as an *action* in your GitHub action YAML configuration
