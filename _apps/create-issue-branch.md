# Create Issue Branch

> A GitHub app that creates a new branch after assigning an issue

Built in response to this feature reuest issue: 
https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1125

## What does this app do?

The typical workflow is:
 1. An issue is created, for example: Issue 15: Fix nasty bug!

 *some time may pass*
 
 2. The issue is assigned
 3. When the issue is assigned this app will create a new issue branch
    (for the example issue this branch will be called `issue-15-Fix_nasty_bug`)

If the issue is re-assigned no new branch will be created.

## Installation

You can install the app directly from [*this page*](https://github.com/apps/create-issue-branch)
