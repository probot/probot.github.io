A GitHub App that comments on and closes issues labeled as support requests.

## Usage

1. **[Install the GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/support)**
   for the intended repositories
2. Create `.github/support.yml` based on the template below
3. Start labeling issues as support requests

**If possible, install the app only for select repositories.
Do not leave the `All repositories` option selected, unless you intend
to use the app for all current and future repositories.**

#### Configuration

Create `.github/support.yml` in the default branch to enable the app,
or add it at the same file path to a repository named `.github`.
The file can be empty, or it can override any of these default settings:

```yaml
# Configuration for Support Requests - https://github.com/dessant/support-requests

# Label used to mark issues as support requests
supportLabel: support

# Comment to post on issues marked as support requests, `{issue-author}` is an
# optional placeholder. Set to `false` to disable
supportComment: >
  :wave: @{issue-author}, we use the issue tracker exclusively for bug reports
  and feature requests. However, this issue appears to be a support request.
