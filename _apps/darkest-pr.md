## What is this?

Darkest-PR (PR stands for Pull-Request) is a GitHub app/bot to narrate your development, making development more exciting *or desperate*.

When certain events occur in the repository, Darkest-PR automatically evaluates the situation and responds with a ***fitting*** quote of ancestor from Darkest Dungeon.
Making the development more like a dungeon crawler run, a sensational journey, more *alive*, more sentimental, more thrilling and more depressing...

Depending on the contextual emotional matrix of the event, it could respond with a quote that'll raise the spirits of your teammates, rally their souls, or it could leave a comment to shame them for their failure, or compliment their greatness, strike fear into their hearts, speak out loud their rage. 

Imagine such cases:
- Someone is removed from PR assignment and the bot responds with:
  - > "Send this one to journey elsewhere, for we have need of sterner stock."
- PR is rejected (request change) and the bot responds with:
  - > "Carelessness will find no clemency in this place!"
- PR is closed without merge and the bot responds with:
  - > "A setback, but not the end of things!"
- PR is accepted and merged immediately and the bot responds with:
  - > "A singular strike!"
- Someone is assigned to an issue and the bot responds with:
  - > "More arrive, foolishly seeking fortune and glory in this domain of the damned.",

Sometimes the quotes are so fitting, so perfect for the situation; it makes development a marvelous journey. Such epic that is worth narrating.

## Usage

### Demo

#### Demo Repository
There is a [demo repository](https://github.com/skywarth/bot-test-repo) I've been using since the development of the project.
- [Demo PR](https://github.com/skywarth/bot-test-repo/pull/13)
- [Demo issue (Issue events)](https://github.com/skywarth/bot-test-repo/issues/12)
- [Demo issue (by comment)](https://github.com/skywarth/bot-test-repo/issues/11)

Go ahead and take a look at it there, maybe even add a comment tagging the app like `@Darkest-PR` and you will get a quote from the ancestor.
