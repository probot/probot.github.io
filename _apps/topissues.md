## How It Works

The Top Issues bot runs every 25 minutes, labeling top issues and unlabeling issues that are no longer top issues.  Top issues are issues with the most "+1" emoji reactions on the issue description.  "+1" emoji reactions on issues comments are not considered.  

## Installation

After installing the app, create a `topissuebot.yml` file to the `.github` directory to enable the bot. The file must contain the following properties.  Customize the values as desired.

```yml
# Configuration for top-issue-bot
labelName: ":thumbsup: Top Issue!"
labelColor: "f442c2"
numberOfIssuesToLabel: 5
```
