## How It Works

The Top Issues bot runs every 25 minutes, labeling top issues and unlabeling issues that are no longer top issues.  Top issues are issues with the most "+1" emoji reactions on the issue description.  "+1" emoji reactions on issues comments are not considered.  

## Installation

The Top Issue bot is being deprecated in favor of the [Top Issues GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/top-issues-labeler).  The bot will be removed on September 15, 2019.
