A GitHub App that locks closed issues and pull requests after
a period of inactivity.

## Usage

1. **[Install the GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/lock)**
   for the intended repositories
2. Create `.github/lock.yml` based on the template below
3. It will start scanning for closed issues and/or pull requests within an hour

**If possible, install the app only for select repositories.
Do not leave the `All repositories` option selected, unless you intend
to use the app for all current and future repositories.**

#### Configuration

Create `.github/lock.yml` in the default branch to enable the app,
or add it at the same file path to a repository named `.github`.
The file can be empty, or it can override any of these default settings:

```yaml
# Configuration for Lock Threads - https://github.com/dessant/lock-threads

# Number of days of inactivity before a closed issue or pull request is locked
daysUntilLock: 365

# Skip issues and pull requests created before a given timestamp. Timestamp must
# follow ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Set to `false` to disable
skipCreatedBefore: false

# Issues and pull requests with these labels will be ignored. Set to `[]` to disable
exemptLabels: []

# Label to add before locking, such as `outdated`. Set to `false` to disable
lockLabel: false

# Comment to post before locking. Set to `false` to disable
lockComment: >
  This thread has been automatically locked since there has not been
  any recent activity after it was closed. Please open a new issue for
  related bugs.

# Assign `resolved` as the reason for locking. Set to `false` to disable
setLockReason: true

# Limit to only `issues` or `pulls`
# only: issues

# Optionally, specify configuration settings just for `issues` or `pulls`
# issues:
#   exemptLabels:
#     - help-wanted
#   lockLabel: outdated

# pulls:
#   daysUntilLock: 30

# Repository to extend settings from
# _extends: repo
```
