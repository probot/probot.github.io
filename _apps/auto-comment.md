## Usage

Using **auto-comment** is simple. Once you've installed it in your repository you will need to setup your `./github/auto-comment.yml` file and **auto-comment** will do the rest.

## Configuring for your project

There are a couple of configuration options that you will need to setup depending on what you want.

```yml
