## Use programmatically

Install it using [**yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com) **v1** or above / [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com) **v5** or above.

```
$ yarn add triage-new-issues
```

## Install it to your profile

Go to https://github.com/apps/triage-new-issues and click the green "install" button.

Very much appreciated the work of **Gyandeep Singh ([@gyandeeps](https://github.com/gyandeeps))** on
the plugin for the [ESLint's GitHub Bot](https://github.com/eslint/eslint-github-bot/tree/4dd943a51b415b0b2053b4a4ae75a4e9244fcb09/src/plugins/triage)!

In addition to it, to safe UI clicking and time, I just added ability to auto-remove `triage` label when another label is added.

## Deploying

We hosting it on https://triage-new-issues.now.sh/, but if you want to host it yourself

1. Decide where to host
2. Check out [Probot Docs on deploying](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/)
3. Make sure your deployment service run the `start` script

**ProTip:** If you choose to host on [Now](https://www.now.sh), check `now secrets help`

**Note:** As of 15 November 2017, deploying on Now needs this workaround - [probot/probot#318](https://github.com/probot/probot/issues/318#issuecomment-343010573)
