* VS Code support is [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ikuyadeu.devreplay)

## Usage

1. Install this app from https://github.com/apps/dev-avatar
2. Create your own programming style(`devreplay.json`) on the root like bellow
(**Recommend**) [Review Pattern Generator](https://github.com/Ikuyadeu/review_pattern_gen) can generate your rule file automatically
```json
[
    {
        "condition": [
            "for $0 in xrange(${1:name}.$2):"
        ],
        "consequent": [
            "import six",
            "for $0 in six.moves.range(${1:name}.$2):"
        ],
    }
]
```
This mean if your code has `xrange`, it should be `six.moves.range`

And create your code(`hello.py`) like this.
```python
for a in xrange(array.x):
    pass
```
3. The developer(you) submits a pull request
4. This bot suggests source code changes based on pattern.
