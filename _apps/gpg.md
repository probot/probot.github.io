## Usage

[Configure this app](https://github.com/apps/gpg) on your organizations and repositories. Be sure to enable [required status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-required-status-checks/) if you want to enforce GPG signatures on all pull requests.

## How it works

Git supports [signing commits with GPG keys](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work) to verify commit authorship beyond the easy-to-forge [author](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#git-commit---authorltauthorgt) field.

GitHub supports [verifying GPG signatures on commits](https://github.com/blog/2144-gpg-signature-verification) and has an excellent [series of help articles](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg/) for creating a GPG key, using it with `git` locally, and linking it to your GitHub account.

After installation, this app [checks all commits](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/#compare-two-commits) of new (or newly updated) pull requests for valid GPG signatures [according to the GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-04-04-git-signing-api-preview/). Note that for the status check to pass, _every_ contributor of a pull request must:
- set up a GPG key on their local machine
- sign _all_ of their commits in the pull request with that key
- link that key with their GitHub account

![GPG Status Check Success](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/235875/30783301-3b314432-a106-11e7-8e15-68ef7584f076.png "GPG Status Check Success")

Otherwise, the app will set the status to `failed`.
