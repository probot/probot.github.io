## Auto-Me-Bot

Managing a repository can be cumbersome :construction_worker: and tiresome :tired_face:.</br>
Let alone managing multiple repositories used by multiple contributors and bots :anguished:.

My name is [**auto-me-bot**][auto-me-bot-app]!</br>
I was created with [Probot][probot-pages] :robot: and I live my life as a _serverless function_ residing in [AWS Lambda][aws-lambda] :floppy_disk:.

I'm here to take some of the repo management load off your shoulders, just tell me what you want me to do...</br>
Place a file :memo: called **auto-me-bot.yml** in your **.github** folder :file_folder: in the repos you want me to help out with.

```yaml
# .github/auto-me-bot.yml
---
pr:
  conventionalCommits: # this means I'll enforce conventional commit messages in PRs.
  signedCommits: # this means I'll make sure all commits in PRs are signed with the 'Signed-off-by' trailer.
  tasksList: # this means I'll verify completion of tasks list in PRs.
```

> Place the file in your **.github** repository if you want me to take on multiple repos with one file :muscle:.

Check out the [documentation][auto-me-bot-docs] to see what else I can do :call_me_hand:.

Here are some pics of me working:
