# Organization workflows app

This GitHub app allows you to centrally manage and run multiple [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflows across multiple repositories. Currently this is a limitation in GitHub Actions, as it only allows you to configure and manage Actions workflows on a repository level. This app helps you - for example - to centrally define central workflows for linting, compliance checks, and more.

## Installation
You can install the app by [clicking here](https://github.com/apps/organization-workflows). Make sure you install it on all repositories:

If you don't want to install it on all repositories, then make sure to at least include the `.github` repository of your organization. 

<img width="400" alt="Screenshot 2020-12-18 at 17 14 27" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24505883/102636098-81763c80-4154-11eb-80f5-50e21b33020f.png">

After you install the app, you can create a centrally managed workflow. There are a couple of things to keep in mind when you do this: 

### Listening to the right event
This app dispatches workflow runs with the `repository_dispatch` event and the `org-workflow-bot` type. Create a new workflow in the `.github/workflows` directory of your organization's `.github` repository with the yml definition below:

```yml
name: compliance-check 

on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [org-workflow-bot]  # <-- requirement to trigger central workflows 
```

### Registering the run
To let this app keep track of Action runs and expose this information back to the original commit in the source repository it needs to register the workflow run. Like in the example below, start the workflow by registering the run. After this you can add your steps and jobs like you would in a typical Actions workflow.

```yml
name: compliance-check 

on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [org-workflow-bot]  
   
jobs:
  register-and-lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: SvanBoxel/organization-workflow@main
      with:
        id: ${{ github.event.client_payload.id }}
        callback_url: ${{ github.event.client_payload.callback_url }}
        sha: ${{ github.event.client_payload.sha }}
        run_id: ${{ github.run_id }}
        name: ${{ github.workflow }} # Default: name of workflow. This name is shown with the check, but can be changed.

# ... the checks and jobs that need to happen in your workflow.
``` 
Make sure to not change the `id`, `callback_url`, `sha`, and `run_id`. The `name` argument is shown next to the check on the original commit and can be changed. (default is the name of the workflow)

_(‚òù source repository)_

You have the possibilty to show the user specific documentation or enforce specific checks, see [Action inputs](#action-inputs) for more information about this. 

> üëÄ Optional: If you don't register the run, the workflow is triggered without providing information to the user that pushed the commit like in the image above. You can still manually provide this information using one of the [Check Actions](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&query=checks) that is available in the GitHub Marketplace. 

### Checking out code
Because the [GITHUB_SECRET](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#about-the-github_token-secret) is scoped to the repository it is running in, you need to leverage the GitHub App to get access to the repository that triggered the workflow. You can use the repository, ref, and token that is supplied in the dispatch payload by the app for this:

```yml
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.4
      with:
        repository: ${{ github.event.client_payload.repository.full_name }}
        ref: ${{ github.event.client_payload.sha }}
        token: ${{ github.event.client_payload.token }}
    - name: Markdown Lint  
```

> ‚ùó The token in the dispatch payload is redacted in the workflow logs and cannot be used by users that only have read access to the `.github` repository. Any user who has _push access to the main branch of the `.github` repository_ can however use this token in a workflow and execute commands that are within the scope of this application. (See [App permissions](#app-permission))

### üöÄ Ready to go
You're ready to go! Two examples of centralized workflow can be found [here](./examples), an example organization that uses this app [here](https://github.com/saturn-inc), and [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ums09BTHwS2h2TrH9dLsw5z98wFvJxDa/view?usp=sharing) explains from start to end how to set it up yourself. 

### App permissions
This app needs the following permissions:

- **Repository admimistration**: To set or enforce protected branch settings.
- **Checks**: To interact with the checks API.
- **Contents**: To checkout the code in a workflow run.
- **Metadata**: To retrieve repository metadata information.

## How it works
When installed in an organization, the app's logic is triggered by any `push` event. When this happens, the app collects all relevant information and [dispatches](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch) this to the `.github` repository of your organization. Here, all central workflow files configured with the `repository_dispatch` event and `org-workflow-bot` type are triggered.

To map commits, checks, and workflow run, and to make sure workflows can rerun without any problem, some data persistence is needed. Because of this you need to register the run at the start of a workflow. When the workflow finishes the app retrieves what source repository and commit triggered the central workflow, and exposes the workflow results back to the original commit. This data (source repository, check id, sha, and run id) is automatically removed after 90 days. 

## Action inputs

- **id (required)**: ID of run (provided by GitHub app via `github.event.client_payload.id`)  
- **run_id (required)**: ID of workflow run (provided via GitHub syntax `github.run_id`)  
- **name (required)**: Name of check (Use `github.workflow` to use the name of the workflow)  
- **callback_url (required)**: Callback url for register call (provided by GitHub app via `github.event.client_payload.callback_url`)  
- **sha (required)**: Sha of original commit (provided by GitHub app via `github.event.client_payload.sha`)  
- **enforce**: Enforce [required status check](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-required-status-checks). _Default: false_ 
- **enforce_admin** Enforce [required status check](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-required-status-checks) for admins. _Default: false_
- **documentation**: Link to documentation of this check. This is shown with the status check on the original commit. (eg `.github/workflows/compliance-info.md`) _Default: null_
    
```yml
    - uses: SvanBoxel/organization-workflow@main
      with:
        id: ${{ github.event.client_payload.id }}
        callback_url: ${{ github.event.client_payload.callback_url }}
        sha: ${{ github.event.client_payload.sha }}
        run_id: ${{ github.run_id }}
        name: ${{ github.workflow }}
        enforce: true
        enforce_admin: true
        documentation: "README.md"
```
## Development
### Codespaces
A [Codespaces environment](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is defined so you can get started right away. Open this repository in the codespace and run `npm run dev` to start the app in development mode. It will prompt you to follow a couple of instruction to configure your GitHub app and set your .env values. 

<img width="679" alt="Screenshot 2020-12-22 at 13 29 01" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24505883/102888754-ae2e9a80-4459-11eb-92cf-5789f945e4d8.png">

This codespaces comes and configured installed with:
- A local MongoDB environment
- Localtunnel for webhook and request forwarding
- NodeJS

### Setup locally
This app depends on NodeJS to run the application and MongoDB for data persistence. Follow the following steps to run this app locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

Then, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and populate it with your MongoDB host and credentials and your proxy url. Make sure to run a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) to expose your application to the internet. Smee.io is not supported, as it is a webhook proxy service and cannot forward Express endpoint calls

Now you can run the app with the following command:
```bash
npm run build:watch
```

This will prompt you to visit http://localhost:3000 and configure the app on the GitHub side. After you do this it will automatically populate the `APP_ID`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET` and `PRIVATE_KEY` field in the `.env` file.

### Build, test, and run
```
npm run build
npm test
npm run start
```

### Infrastructure
You can find a Terraform definition in the `./infra` directory for deployments to Azure.
