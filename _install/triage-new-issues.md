## Deploying

We are hosting it on https://triage-new-issues.now.sh/, but if you want to host it yourself

1. Decide where to host
2. Check out [Probot Docs on deploying](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/)
3. Make sure your deployment service run the `start` script

**ProTip:** If you choose to host on [Now](https://www.now.sh), check `now secrets help`

**Note:** As of 15 November 2017, deploying on Now needs this workaround - [probot/probot#318](https://github.com/probot/probot/issues/318#issuecomment-343010573)

# Deploying

If you would like to run your own instance of this plugin, see the [docs for deploying plugins](https://github.com/probot/probot/blob/master/docs/deployment.md).
